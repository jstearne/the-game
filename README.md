# the-game
First official project

A Javascript/HTML/CSS scrolling top-down "shooter" without the shooting. Dodge enemies long enough for the countdown to end - then you win!

Difficulty with collision detection will be worked out soon!

Use your keyboard's standard arrow keys to dodge the "bogeys." They will fly down screen at varying speeds, so don't get too comfortable!  


Future changes:
Collision detection, explosions
Difficulty setting (speed up or slow down interval)
Title Splash Screen with difficulty and high scores displayed
