# ApplicationName

## Concept: 
First official project

A Javascript/HTML/CSS scrolling top-down "shooter" without the shooting. Dodge enemies long enough for the countdown to end - then you win!

Difficulty with collision detection will be worked out soon!

Use your keyboard's standard arrow keys to dodge the "bogeys." They will fly down screen at varying speeds, so don't get too comfortable!

Future changes: Collision detection, explosions Difficulty setting (speed up or slow down interval) Title Splash Screen with difficulty and high scores displayed

## PERSONAL NOTES (DELETE ME)

My project must be a game that can be won or lost. Do it on my PERSONAL github (the-game)

1. DRAW IT OUT ON PAPER
2. PSUEDOCODE IT
3. LIST FUNCTIONS/VARIABLES/OBJECTS
4. CODE IT!

can I make an R-Type game? This must use DOM, no console gaming

Race game where obstacles "fall" at me to simulate me racing an obstacle course
